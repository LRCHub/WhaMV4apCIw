Life is good, we all go crazy
Light the fire and come with me
Dancing at the Christmas party
Lots of wine and the boys get cheeky

Oh baby baby
Underneath the mistletoe
Oops baby baby
Getting sexy in the snow
Yeah baby baby
Take the reigns and hold on tight
This could be your luck night

Everybody come together
It's a hot hot Christmas night
Make the magic last forever
Have a cheeky Christmas time

Come and get your Christmas present
Close your eyes and make a wish
If you've been a really good boy
I will be your special dish

Oh baby baby
Underneath the mistletoe
Oops baby baby
Getting sexy in the snow
Yeah baby baby
Take the reigns and hold on tight
This could be your luck night

Everybody come together
It's a hot hot Christmas night
Make the magic last forever
Have a cheeky Christmas time

It's Christmas
Have a cheeky Christmas

One two
Santa Claus is coming
Three four
Feeling up my stockings
Five six
Everybody's pumping
Christmas! Christmas! Christmas!

Everybody come together
It's a hot hot Christmas night
Make the magic last forever
Have a cheeky Christmas time
